- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jakeisadev

mortar_board I am Jacob Starowicz, a Front End Web Developer (Looking to eventually specialize in React Applications). I am also pursuing a Front End Web Development Tech Degree from Team Treehouse to solidify my knowledge of the foundational languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

man_technologist I enjoy tossing on some deep house music and building projects. I am really enthusiastic about learning new technology. I have a YouTube channel with over 400 subscribers where I motivate and teach others how to navigate the Self-Taught Web Developer journey, as well as run a Discond server to interact with my subscribers to either shoot the breeze or personally advise.

skateboard Outside the world of tech, I enjoy longboarding, going for long walks in the park, and exploring different venues while getting to know the people I run into at random. Life can be so fun, I always look forward to interacting with others even though I can be quite an introvert at times.

books I also love reading books on personal development. My favorite ones are really anything by Wayne Dyer, Stuart Wilde, or anyone of note within the sphere of spirituality. I also dabble in topics such as Men's Health, Financial Literacy, and relationships. I strive to be the most well rounded individual that I can be.

airplane I love traveling too. I moved to NC solo immediately after obtaining my Bachelor's Degree in Communication & Social Interaction in Central NY. I plan to visit states like Arizona, Texas, and California soon. Later on, I'd love to check out countries like Portugal, Sweden, and Romania.
